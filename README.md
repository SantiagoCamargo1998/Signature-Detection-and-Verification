# Signature-Detection-and-Verification
This project detects and verifies handwritten signatures in scanned documents using image processing and machine learning. It extracts signatures, compares them to a pre-built database using SIFT features and Isolation Forest. Includes code, dataset, and setup instructions.


## Overview
This project aims to detect and verify handwritten signatures from scanned documents using image processing techniques and machine learning models. Includes all code and dataset for setup.



## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains the Python scripts for signature detection and verification.
- **signatures_dataset/**: Includes the dataset used for testing, such as TIFF/PNG images.
- **test_documents/**: Supporting images used for demonstration.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Signature-Detection-and-Verification.git
